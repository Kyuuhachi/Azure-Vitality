## Installation
Download the `vitality.tar.gz` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/Kyuuhachi/Azure-Vitality/releases)
and extract `data/` directory into the game's directory (you can open it like a .zip file).
This is normally at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Legend of Heroes Trails to Azure`,
or it can be found by right-clicking the game in Steam and choosing Manage Â» Browse local files.

If using ShinKiseki's [More Portraits in Azure](https://github.com/shinkiseki/MorePortraitsInAzure),
install that one first, and then install `vitality-portraits.tar.gz` on top of
that. The base `vitality.tar.gz` is not necessary.

## FAQ

**Can I install this mid-playthrough?** Yes. But I can't guarantee stability if
you are in an area with added NPCs, so I would recommend saving on one of the
highways.

**Do these support English/Japanese?** Yes, both languages are fully supported.

**Are they voiced?** No. They're not voiced in Evolution, so there are no voice
clips for them.

**Do you receive any DP?/Does this affect achievements?** Yes, it does make
detective ranks easier to attain since there are more DP in total. I believe
adjusting the rank thresholds would require modding the exe, which is beyond
the scope of this mod.
